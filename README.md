# Text Editor

The editor works in 3 modes:  
1. **Insert / Edit mode** - Enables the user to insert new text and edit the text of the current file.  
2. **Normal mode** - Primarily used for navigation of the cursor within the file. Also allows for the manipulation of text using key combinations.  
3. **Command-line mode** - For entering editor commands, your custom commands, as well as shell commands to be run.  

### Learning objectives :  
1. Gaining familiarity with basic programming in linux.  
2. Use of general terminal interface libraries to interact and programmatically control the terminal.  
3. Know how the linux terminal works under canonical (default) mode; and understand how to get finer control over raw input processing and raw output rendering.  
4. Acquaint with common linux system calls to perform numerous actions, along with other low level wrapper functions located in different low level header files (e.g. termios.h, unistd.h, sys/ioctl.h etc.)   
5. Use of efficient data structures and algorithmic procedures for text manipulation, storage and rendering.
